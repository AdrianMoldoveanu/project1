     ### Further Testing

     -   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
     -   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7 & Nokia5.
     -   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
     -   My girlfriend and coworkers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues
    
    ### Design 

       #### Colour Scheme
           
           - The two main colours used are white and yellow to impact better with the background image.
       
       #### Typography

           - Roboto with fallback on Sans Serif is the main font used throughout the website. I find it both attractive and appropiate.

       #### Imagery 

           - As a background image I choose a gaming related colorful picture which blends well with the theme of the website. For the image i choose clean pictures with enough resolution to not appear pixelated on any screen size.

 5. The page will automatically refresh.
 6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

 By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

 1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
 2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
 3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

 1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
 2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
 3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
 4. Open Git Bash
 5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
 6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
 
 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
 ```

 7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

 ```
 $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
 > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
 > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
 > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
